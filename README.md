## 🔐 How our authentication works ##

Unlike the admin platform, the regular DailySAT platform's auth is handled by the AuthJS lib. It features simple Google SSO and its contents are saved onto a MongoDB collection called "users." This is then used to populate the dashboard with user information. We also employed a rate limiter to regulate the amount of DB calls. This way there is less burden on our MongoDB server. During the times when the API is restircted, we use a caching layer to populate the information

## 💻 Technology Stack:
- **NextJS** (frontend and backend, good for SEO)
- **TailwindCSS** (styling)
- **MongoDB** (db management solution)
- **Redis** (storage solution for sessions, rate limiting and caching layer)
- **Husky** (pre-commit solution to run commands prior to a commit)
- **ESLint** (used for linting enforcement)

## 📚 School B2B Model:

Schools can now partner with DailySAT. It is **free of charge**. Once partnered, their school will be added to the `school` collection in MongoDB. In /schools route, this collection will be shown and students can enroll into one school from that collection. They can then work on questions normally. Data from these interactions (correct answers/incorrect answers) will be stored within the `school` collection document and authorized teachers will be able to see each student and how they are doing. Teachers get authenticated through their emails, it is cross referenced with the `school` document and if their email is found they get access to /schools/dashboard?school=SCHOOL NAME.
